This dissertation examines suburbanization of poverty in Canadian cities during the late 20th and early 21st centuries, with particular focus on it's relation to the distribution of transportation infrastructure and travel behaviour outcomes. The body of this dissertation consists of a literature review followed by three quantitative research papers. The first examines suburbanization of poverty in Toronto over a 25 year period relative to changes in public transit accessibility and adverse travel behaviour outcomes (e.g. longer commute times). The second uses panel data to analyze and tabulate individual pathways to suburban poverty across Canada. And the third directly asks whether low-income residents are disproportionately moving away from public transit. Findings show that many suburban areas are not only declining in socio-economic status, but are also experiencing worsening travel restrictions, evidenced by longer commute times and lower activity participation rates. Importantly, the primary pathway to suburban poverty is sourced from residents dropping into poverty in the suburbs, rather than from moving away from central areas or due to immigration. Moreover, while low-income residents reduce their level of transit accessibility when they move, they are not doing so at a greater rate than higher-income movers. Overall, this research generates important knowledge about the changing structure of urban neighbourhoods while also providing pertinent information to aid preventative policy aimed at reducing suburban poverty in Canada.

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Acknowledgements}

While there is only one name on the title of this document, it could not have been accomplished without the help of many others. There are the countless academics, journalists, urban planners, and cartographers, among others, whose work have influenced my thoughts and ideas over the past few years. Secondly, much of the empirical work in this dissertation was based on data collected and administrated by others. The Data Management Group and the Travel Modelling Group at the University of Toronto graciously provided the travel survey data and travel time matrices, respectively, while the tax-record data was accessed at the Toronto Research Data Centre. All of the data analysis throughout this dissertation was conducted via open source software, and I am ever appreciative of the broader open source community. During my time as a graduate student, I received funding from the University of Toronto, the Government of Ontario, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, as well as a research stipend from my supervisor, Steven Farber. My PhD would not have been possible without this financial support. Steven Farber, alongside my committee members, Chris Higgins and Dan Silver, also provided excellent guidance and feedback at various stages of my research. I would also like to thank my fellow grad students at the SAUSy Lab, both for their help and procrastinating conversations. In particular, I would like to thank Nate Wessel, Mischa Young, Amber DeJohn, and Matthew Palm for their advice at various stage as well as their friendship along the way. Last but not least, I am ever grateful to my partner, Sarah Kaissi, and my mum, Carol Allen for their love and support.

\chapter*{Preface}

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Preface}

This dissertation can be read as a complete and coherent document, however Chapters \ref{ch:subtrapov}, \ref{ch:pathsubpov}, and \ref{ch:lowinctra} were originally written as separate articles. As such, there is some redundancy in the introductory material, literature reviews, and methods sections of each. As each of the chapters provides some of its own context, the goal of Chapter \ref{ch:intro} of this dissertation is to frame the issues motivating this research as a coherent body of work. Similarly, Chapter \ref{ch:conc} serves to tie together the results of each article into broader implications and research contributions as well as to suggest future lines of research.
