Growth of poverty in suburban neighbourhoods relative to more centrally located neighbourhoods (i.e. suburbanizationo of poverty) and  

This dissertation examines suburbanization of poverty in Canadian cities during the late 20th and early 21st centuries with particular focus on it's relation to to transportation infrastructure and travel behaviour outcomes.

The body of this dissertation consists of a literature review followed by three quantitative research papers. The first examines suburbanization of poverty in Toronto over a 25 year period relative to changes in public transit accessibility and adverse travel behaviour outcomes (e.g. longer commute times). The second uses panel data to analyze and tabulate individual pathways to suburban poverty. And third directly asks whether low-income residents are disproportionately moving away from public transit. Findings show that many suburban areas are not only declining in socio-economic status, but are also experiencing worsening travel restrictions, evidenced by longer commute times and lower activity participation rates. However, the  primary pathway to suburban poverty is sourced from residents dropping into poverty in the suburbs, rather than from moving away from central areas or due to immigration. Moreover, while low-income residents are move away from transit , they are not doing so at a greater rate than higher-income movers. 

Overall, this research has important implications both for

\chapter*{Preface}

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Preface}

This dissertation can be read as a complete and coherent document, however Chapters \ref{ch:subtrapov}, \ref{ch:pathsubpov}, and \ref{ch:lowinctra} were originally written as separate articles to be published in peer-reviewed academic journals. As such, there is some redundancy in the introductory material, literature reviews, and methods sections of each. 

At the time of writing, Chapter \ref{ch:subtrapov} has been published in the Annals of the AAG \cite{allen_suburbanization_2021}; Chapter \ref{ch:pathsubpov} is under review at Environment and Planning A; and Chapter \ref{ch:lowinctra} is under review at the Journal of Transport and Land Use. I am first author on each of these publications and take full responsibility for omissions or errors in the analysis. 

As each of the chapters provides some of its own context, the goal of Chapter \ref{ch:intro} of this dissertation is to frame the issues motivating this research as a coherent body of work. Similarly, Chapter \ref{ch:conc} serves to tie together the results of each article into broader implications and research contributions as well as to suggest future lines of research.
